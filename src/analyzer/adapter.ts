 *  Previously this scored the TABLET's own roll against a separate,
 *  smaller cap (`TABLET_ROLL_CAP`), with the waystone's stats only leaking
 *  in via a small capped `computeSynergyBonus` — that's why a real waystone
 *  with +62% Monster Rarity still showed a weak Abyss Tablet fit (its own
 *  roll didn't have Pack Size, the-then priority stat). Removed along with
 *  the confidence/secondary-mechanic multipliers (×0.92/×0.8) and the
 *  inert `minThresholds` scaffold — none were validated against real data,
 *  and stacking multiple unsourced multipliers on top of a now-correct
 *  base score was exactly the "hard to reason about" complaint that
 *  triggered this rework (KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
 *
 *  A mechanic's optional `recommendedTablets` pin (meta.json-editable,
 *  meta-schema.ts) still adds a flat +10 bonus for the curated tablet.
 *  `rewardScore` (rewards.ts, real mechanic-specific currency) is added on
 *  top, clamped to 0-100. List order is by fit descending, best tablet
 *  first (2026-07-12, user request — reverting the same-day alphabetical
 *  change once the fit % became visible per row, since a fixed order no
